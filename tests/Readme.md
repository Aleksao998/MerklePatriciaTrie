# ðŸ§ª Integration Tests Module

This module is dedicated to integration tests for validating the functionality and robustness of our implementation.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

## ðŸ“œ Tests Available

Currently, we have the following tests:

1. **triehash_test.go**: This is an integration test that loads data from `example.json`. It compares the hash from the JSON with a newly generated hash using this library to ensure consistency and correctness.

Ensure your environment is set up correctly and enjoy testing! âœ…
